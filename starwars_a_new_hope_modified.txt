'''''Star Wars''''' (retroactively titled '''''Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope''''') is a 1977 American [[Epic film|epic]] [[space opera]] film written and directed by [[George Lucas]], produced by [[Lucasfilm]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is the first film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series and fourth chronological chapter of the "[[Skywalker Saga]]". Set "a long time ago" in a [[fictional universe]] where the galaxy is ruled by the tyrannical [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], the story focuses on a group of [[freedom fighter]]s known as the [[Rebel Alliance]], who aim to destroy the Empire's newest weapon, the [[Death Star]]. [[Luke Skywalker]] becomes caught in the conflict while learning the ways of a metaphysical power known as "[[the Force]]" from [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. The cast includes [[Mark Hamill]], [[Harrison Ford]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Peter Cushing]], [[Alec Guinness]], [[David Prowse]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], and [[Peter Mayhew]].

Lucas had the idea for a science-fiction film in the vein of ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' around the time he completed his first film, ''[[THX 1138]]'' (1971) and began working on a treatment after the release of ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973). After numerous rewrites, filming took place throughout 1976 in locations including Tunisia and [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England. The film suffered production difficulties; cast and crew involved believed the film would be a failure. Lucas formed the production company [[Industrial Light & Magic]] to help create the film's special effects. It also went $3 million over budget due to multiple delays.

''Star Wars'' was released in a limited number of theaters in the United States on May 25, 1977 and quickly became a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] hit, leading to it being expanded to a much wider release. The film opened to critical acclaim for its acting, direction, story, musical score, sound, editing, screenplay, costume design, and production values, but particularly for its groundbreaking visual effects. It grossed over $550 million during its initial run, surpassing ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) to become the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] until the release of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982); subsequent releases brought its total gross to $775 million. When adjusted for inflation, ''Star Wars'' is the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|second-highest-grossing film in North America]] (behind ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'') and the [[Highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation|fourth-highest-grossing film of all time]]. It received numerous awards at the [[50th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], [[BAFTA|BAFTA Awards]], [[Saturn Awards]], among others.

The film has been reissued many times with Lucas's support—most significantly with its 20th-anniversary theatrical "Special Edition"—incorporating [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#Star Wars|many changes]] including modified [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] effects, altered dialogue, {{nowrap|re-edited}} shots, remixed soundtracks and added scenes. Widely regarded as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest and most important films]] in [[History of film|cinema history]], the film became a [[Cultural impact of Star Wars|pop-cultural phenomenon]], launching an industry of tie-in products, including [[List of Star Wars books|novels]], [[List of Star Wars comics|comics]], [[List of Star Wars video games|video games]], [[List of Star Wars theme parks attractions|amusement park attractions]] and [[:Category:Star Wars merchandise|merchandise]] including toys, games, and clothing. It became one of the first 25 films selected by the United States [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 1989, while [[Star Wars (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]] was added to the U.S. [[National Recording Registry]] in 2004. ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) followed ''Star Wars'', rounding out the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. A&nbsp;[[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel]] and a [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] have since been released, in addition to two [[List of Star Wars films#Anthology films|anthology films]] and various [[List of Star Wars television series|television series]].

[[File:Leiadeathstar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Luke Skywalker (Hamill), Princess Leia (Fisher), and Han Solo (Ford)]]
Amid a galactic civil war, [[Rebel Alliance]] spies have stolen plans <!-- *Please don't link to Rogue One per WP:EASTEREGG & because RO didn't exist in 1977* --> to the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]'s [[Death Star]], a massive [[space station]] capable of destroying entire planets. Imperial Senator [[Princess Leia Organa]] of [[Alderaan]], secretly one of the Rebellion's leaders, has obtained its schematics, but her starship<!-- *Please do not add Tantive IV's explicit name – it was not named in the 1977 script --> is intercepted by an Imperial [[Star Destroyer]] under the command of the ruthless [[Darth Vader]]. Before she is captured, Leia hides the plans in the memory system of [[Droid (Star Wars)#Astromech droids|astromech droid]] {{nowrap|[[R2-D2]]}}, who flees in an escape pod to the nearby desert planet [[Tatooine]] alongside his companion, [[Droid (Star Wars)#Protocol droids|protocol droid]] {{nowrap|[[C-3PO]]}}.

The droids are captured by [[Jawas|Jawa]] traders, who sell them to moisture farmers [[Owen Lars|Owen]] and [[Beru Lars]] and their nephew [[Luke Skywalker]]. While Luke is cleaning {{nowrap|R2-D2}}, he discovers a [[holographic]] recording of Leia requesting help from an [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Later, after Luke finds R2-D2 missing, he is attacked by scavenging [[Tusken Raiders|Sand People]] while searching for him, but is rescued by elderly [[hermit]] "Old Ben" Kenobi, an acquaintance of Luke's, who reveals that "Obi-Wan" is his true name. Obi-Wan tells Luke of his days as one of the [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]], the former peacekeepers of the [[Galactic Republic]] who drew mystical abilities from a metaphysical energy field known as "[[the Force]]", but were ultimately hunted to near-extinction by the Empire. Luke learns that his father fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] until Vader, Obi-Wan's former pupil, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. Obi-Wan offers Luke his father's old [[lightsaber]], the signature weapon of Jedi Knights.

R2-D2 plays Leia's full message, in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan and give them to [[Bail Organa|her father]], a fellow veteran, for analysis. Although Luke initially declines Obi-Wan's offer to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force, he is left with no choice after discovering that Imperial [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtroopers]] have killed his aunt and uncle and destroyed their farm in their search for the droids. Traveling to a [[cantina]] in [[Mos Eisley]] to search for transport, Luke and Obi-Wan hire [[Han Solo]], a smuggler with a price on his head due to his debt to local mobster [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Pursued by stormtroopers, Obi-Wan, Luke, R2-D2, and {{nowrap|C-3PO}} flee Tatooine with Han and his [[Wookiee]] {{nowrap|co-pilot}} [[Chewbacca]] on their ship the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.

Before the ''Falcon'' can reach Alderaan, Death Star commander [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] destroys the planet in a show of force after interrogating Leia for the location of the Rebel Alliance's base. Upon arrival, the ''Falcon'' is captured by the Death Star's [[tractor beam]], but the group manages to evade capture by hiding in the ship's smuggling compartments. As Obi-Wan leaves to disable the tractor beam, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia after discovering that she is scheduled to be executed. After disabling the tractor beam, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel against Vader, allowing the rest of the group to escape the Death Star with Leia. Using a tracking device, the Empire tracks the ''Falcon'' to the hidden Rebel base on [[Yavin|<!-- don't delink -->Yavin IV]].

The schematics reveal a hidden weakness in the Death Star's thermal exhaust port, which could allow the Rebels to trigger a [[chain reaction]] in its main reactor with a precise proton torpedo strike. While Han abandons the Rebels after collecting his reward for rescuing Leia, Luke joins their [[X-wing fighter|X-wing starfighter]] squadron in a desperate attack against the approaching Death Star. In the ensuing battle, the Rebels suffer heavy losses as Vader leads a squadron of [[TIE fighter]]s against them. Han and Chewbacca unexpectedly return to aid them in the ''Falcon'', and knock Vader's ship off course before he can shoot down Luke. Guided by the disembodied voice of Obi-Wan's [[The Force#Afterlife|spirit]], Luke uses the Force to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, destroying the Death Star moments before it fires on the Rebel base. In a triumphant ceremony at the base, Leia awards Luke and Han medals for their heroism.

* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]]: A young adult raised by his aunt and uncle on [[Tatooine]], who dreams of something more than his current life and learns about [[the Force]] and the [[Jedi]]. Lucas favored casting young actors who lacked long experience. To play Luke (then known as Luke Starkiller), Lucas sought actors who could project intelligence and integrity. While reading the script, Hamill found the dialogue to be extremely odd because of its universe-embedded concepts. He chose to simply read it sincerely, and he was cast instead of [[William Katt]], who was subsequently cast in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (Lucas shared a joint casting session with De Palma, a longtime friend).<ref name="Dreams" /><ref name="casting">{{cite magazine|last=Russo|first=Tom|title=The Force Wasn't With Them|magazine=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|url=http://www.premiere.com/article.asp?section_id=6&article_id=2164 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508222750/http://www.premiere.com/article.asp?section_id=6&article_id=2164 |archive-date=May 8, 2006 |access-date=October 3, 2006}}</ref> [[Robby Benson]], [[Will Seltzer]] and [[Charles Martin Smith]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name="Actors">{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Steven|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/actors-who-almost-appeared-in-star-wars|title=Actors Who Almost Appeared In Star Wars|website=StarWars.com|date=August 20, 2015 |access-date=July 26, 2021}}</ref><ref name="screen">{{cite web|title=timewarptv.com – Star Wars Screen Tests|url=http://www.timewarptv.com/Default.aspx?tabid=141| access-date = 2007-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/amp/mark-hamill-reflects-on-his-competition-for-playing-luke-any-one-of-those-guys-was-perfect/|title=Mark Hamill reflects on his Luke Skywalker competition for Star Wars: "Any one of those guys was perfect"|work=GamesRadar|last=Prell|first=Sam|date=November 20, 2017 |access-date=August 11, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/movies/star-wars-the-last-jedi-luke-skywalker-mark-hamill.amp.html|title=Luke Skywalker Speaks|work=The New York Times|date=October 30, 2017 |access-date=August 11, 2021|last1=Itzkoff|first1=Dave}}</ref>
* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]]: A cynical smuggler hired by Obi-Wan and Luke to take them to [[Alderaan]] in his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', co-piloted with Chewbacca. Lucas initially rejected casting Ford for the role, as he "wanted new faces"; Ford had previously worked with Lucas on ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Instead, Lucas asked Ford to assist in the auditions by reading lines with the other actors and explaining the concepts and history behind the scenes that they were reading.

Lucas commended Cushing's performance, saying "[He] is a very good actor. Adored and idolized by young people and by people who go to see a certain kind of movie. I feel he will be fondly remembered for the next 350 years at least." Cushing, commenting on his role, joked: "I've often wondered what a 'Grand Moff' was.

* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]: An aging [[Jedi Master]] and veteran of the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] who introduces Luke to the Force. Lucas's decision to cast "unknowns" was not taken favorably by his friend [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and the studio. Lucas decided Obi-Wan Kenobi should be played by an established actor. Producer [[Gary Kurtz]] said, "The Alec Guinness role required a certain stability and gravitas as a character... which meant we needed a very, very strong character actor to play that part."<ref name="Dreams" /> Before Guinness was cast, Japanese actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] (who starred in many [[Akira Kurosawa]] films) was considered for the role.<ref name="casting" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5975671/how-star-wars-mightve-had-a-different-darth-vader|title=How Star Wars Might've Had a Different Darth Vader|first=Brian|last=Ashcraft|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku|access-date=December 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073659/http://kotaku.com/5975671/how-star-wars-mightve-had-a-different-darth-vader|archive-date=December 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Mifune's daughter, Mika Kitagawa, her father turned down Lucas's offers for Kenobi and Darth Vader because "he was concerned about how the film would look and that it would cheapen the image of samurai...

He agreed to take the part of Kenobi on the condition that he would not have to do any publicity to promote the film.<ref name="BBCTrivia" /> Lucas credited him with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to the completion of the filming.{{Sfn|Guinness|1986|p = 214}} Harrison Ford said, "It was, for me, fascinating to watch Alec Guinness.

At the [[Cannes Film Festival]] following the completion of ''THX 1138,'' Lucas pushed towards buying the ''Flash Gordon'' rights, but they were already tied-up with [[Dino De Laurentiis]].<ref name="FlashG" /> Lucas later recounted:

{{blockquote|I wanted to make a ''Flash Gordon'' movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where [[Alex Raymond]] (who had done the original ''Flash Gordon'' comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] (author of ''[[Tarzan]]'') and especially from his ''[[John Carter of Mars (collection)|John Carter of Mars]]'' series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a [[science fantasy]] called ''[[Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation|Gulliver on Mars]]'', written by [[Edwin Lester Arnold|Edwin Arnold]] and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. [[Jules Verne]] had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.<ref name="ASCbehind1"/>}}

Director Francis Ford Coppola, who accompanied Lucas in trying to buy the ''Flash Gordon'' rights, recounted in 1999: "[George] was very depressed because he had just come back and they wouldn't sell him ''Flash Gordon''.

Lucas began writing in January 1973, "eight hours a day, five days a week",<ref name="ASCbehind1"/> by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterizations. Lucas would discard many of these by the time the final script was written, but he included several names and places in the final script or its sequels. He used these initial names and ideas to compile a two-page synopsis titled ''Journal of the Whills'', which told the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a "Jedi-Bendu" space commando by the legendary Mace Windy.{{Sfn |Rinzler| 2007|p = 8}} Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand,{{Sfn|Baxter|1999|p = 142}} Lucas then began writing a 13-page [[Film treatment|treatment]] called ''The Star Wars'' on April 17, 1973, which had narrative parallels with Kurosawa's 1958 film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]''.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=50}}

While impressed with the "innocence of the story, plus the sophistication of the world"{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=63}} of the film, United Artists declined to budget the film.

[[File:Gary Kurtz1.jpg|thumb|''Star Wars'' producer [[Gary Kurtz]] (pictured in 2002)]]
Lucas said, "I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. They think I do weirdo films."<ref name="Time77p57" /> According to Kurtz, [[Lew Wasserman]], the head of Universal, "just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience."<ref name="KurtzIGN3"/> He said that "science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... what seems to be the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year."<ref name="KurtzIGN1">{{cite web|last=Kurtz|first=Gary|title=An Interview with Gary Kurtz|date=November 11, 2002|page=1|website=IGN|url=https://ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/an-interview-with-gary-kurtz?page=1 |access-date=May 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513100038/http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/11/an-interview-with-gary-kurtz?page=1|archive-date=May 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Kurtz said, "Although ''Star Wars'' wasn't like [then-current science fiction] at all, it was just sort of lumped into that same kind of category."<ref name="KurtzIGN3"/>

Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not "about the future" and that it "is a fantasy much closer to the [[Brothers Grimm]] than it is to [[2001: A Space Odyssey|''2001'']]." He added: "My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had Westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Now they have ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and ''[[Kojak]]''. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?"<ref name="Time77p57" /> Lucas would later recontextualize the discussion around the film, saying it was born out of research into "psychological underpinings of mythology", a claim that had been dismissed by Kurtz as self-aggrandizing: "The whole idea of Star Wars as a mythological thing, I think came about because of [later Lucas] interviews that tied it to ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Taylor|first=Chris|date=September 27, 2014|title='Star Wars' Producer Blasts 'Star Wars' Myths|url=https://mashable.com/2014/09/27/star-wars-myths-gary-kurtz/|website=mashable.com|access-date=October 15, 2018|archive-date=October 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015153402/https://mashable.com/2014/09/27/star-wars-myths-gary-kurtz/|url-status=live}}</ref> and by Steven Hart and Michael Kaminski: "It is here that the true origin of ''Star Wars'' comes from – not from myth and legend, but from the 'schlock' sold on newspapers stands and played in matinees."{{sfn|Kaminski|2008|page=67}}

There were also concerns regarding the project's potentially high budget. Lucas and Kurtz, in pitching the film, said that it would be "low-budget, [[Roger Corman]] style, and the budget was never going to be more than—well, originally we had proposed about 8 million, it ended up being about 10.

Since commencing his writing process in January 1973, Lucas had done "various rewrites in the evenings after the day's work." He would write four different screenplays for ''Star Wars'', "searching for just the right ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been what you might call a good idea in search of a story."<ref name="ASCbehind1"/> By May 1974, he had expanded the treatment for ''The Star Wars'' into a rough draft screenplay,<ref name="Dreams"/>{{rp|14}}<ref name=ArchivedScripts>{{cite web|title=Starkiller|work=starwarz.com|publisher=Jedi Bendu|url=http://starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628065925/http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts.htm |archive-date=June 28, 2006 |access-date=March 27, 2008}}</ref> adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role as a member of a family of [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]].<ref name="Dreams"/><ref name="Characters"/> Lucas envisioned the [[Corellia]]n smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his [[Alaskan Malamute]] dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as eponym for his character [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]), who often acted as the director's "co-pilot" by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.<ref name="Characters"/>

Lucas completed a second draft in January 1975 as ''Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode One: The Star Wars'', making heavy simplifications and introducing the young hero on a farm as Luke Starkiller. Annikin became Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. "The Force" was also introduced as a mystical energy field.<ref name="ArchivedScripts"/> This draft still had some differences from the final version in the characters and relationships. For example, Luke had several brothers, as well as his father, who appears in a minor role at the end of the film. The script became more of a [[fairy tale]] quest as opposed to the action/adventure of the previous versions. This version ended with another text crawl, previewing the next story in the series. This draft was also the first to introduce the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side: the draft included a historical Jedi who was the first to ever fall to the dark side, and then trained the Sith to use it. The script would introduce the concept of a Jedi Master and his son, who trains to be a Jedi under his father's friend; this would ultimately form the basis for the film and, later, [[Star Wars original trilogy|the trilogy]]. However, in this draft, the father is a hero who is still alive at the start of the film.<ref>{{cite web|date=March 1997|title=The development of Star Wars as Seen Through the Scripts of George Lucas|url=http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/writings/development_jan.htm|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071224155643/http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/writings/development_jan.htm |archive-date=December 24, 2007 |access-date=May 26, 2008}}</ref> Han Solo and Chewbacca's identities closely resembled those seen in the finished film.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Szostak|first=Phil|title=The Art of Solo: A Star Wars Story|publisher=Abrams|year=2018|isbn=978-1-4197-2745-0|location=New York|pages=12|oclc=1037353117}}</ref> According to Lucas, the second draft was over 200 pages long, and led him to split up the story into multiple films spanning over multiple trilogies.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=Kaminski|first=Michael|date=2010|title=The Lost Star Wars Stories: Episodes X-XII|url=http://fd.noneinc.com/secrethistoryofstarwarscom/secrethistoryofstarwars.com/loststarwarsstories.html|website=The Secret History of Star Wars|access-date=November 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111175900/http://fd.noneinc.com/secrethistoryofstarwarscom/secrethistoryofstarwars.com/loststarwarsstories.html|archive-date=November 11, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Lucas began to rewrite this draft, creating a synopsis for the third draft. During work on this rewrite, Lucas began researching the science-fiction genre by watching films and reading books (including [[J. R. R.

According to Lucas, he wrote a rough draft of about 250–300 pages long, which contained the outline for the entire original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.

The third draft, dated August 1, 1975, was titled ''The Star Wars From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller''. This third draft had most of the elements of the final plot, with only some differences in the characters and settings. The draft characterized Luke as an only child, with his father already dead, replacing him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi.<ref name="ArchivedScripts"/> This script would be re-written for the fourth and final draft, dated January 1, 1976, as ''The Adventures of Luke Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars''.

Lucas finished writing his script in March 1976, when the crew started filming. He said, "What finally emerged through the many drafts of the script has obviously been influenced by science-fiction and action-adventure I've read and seen. And I've seen a lot of it.

George Lucas recruited many conceptual designers, including [[Colin Cantwell]], who worked on ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), to conceptualize the initial spacecraft models; Alex Tavoularis to create the preliminary conceptual [[storyboard]] sketches of early scripts; and Ralph McQuarrie to visualize the characters, costumes, props, and scenery.<ref name="ASCbehind1"/> McQuarrie's pre-production paintings of certain scenes from Lucas's early screenplay drafts helped 20th Century-Fox visualize the film, which positively influenced their decision to fund the project. After McQuarrie's drawings for Lucas's colleagues [[Hal Barwood]] and [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]] (who were collaborating for a film) caught his interest, Lucas met with McQuarrie to discuss his plans for the untitled space fantasy film he wanted to make. Two years later, after completing ''American Graffiti'', Lucas approached McQuarrie and asked him if he would be interested "in doing something for ''Star Wars''."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Magid|first1=Ron|date=June–July 2004|title=Ralph McQuarrie on designing Star Wars|work=Star Wars Insider|url=http://www.ralphmcquarrie.com/interviews/insider_76/index.html|publisher=RalphMcQuarrie.com |access-date=December 19, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120510000221/http://www.ralphmcquarrie.com/interviews/insider_76/index.html |archive-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref> McQuarrie produced a series of artworks from simple sketches; these set a visual tone for the film, and for the rest of the original trilogy.<ref name="ASCbehind1"/>

The film was ambitious as Lucas wanted to create fresh prop prototypes and sets (based on McQuarrie's paintings) that had never been realized before in science fiction films. He commissioned production designers [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]] and [[Roger Christian (filmmaker)|Roger Christian]], who were working on the sets of the film ''[[Lucky Lady]]'' (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets. Christian recounted in 2014: "George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And we spoke and he looked at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real." They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets. Christian said that Lucas "didn't want anything [in ''Star Wars''] to stand out, he wanted it [to look] all real and used. And I said, 'Finally somebody's doing it the right way.'"<ref name=EsquireRC>{{cite magazine|last1=Singer|first1=Jeremy|title=The Man Who Literally Build Star Wars|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/star-wars-roger-christian|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|magazine=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |access-date=December 9, 2014|date=May 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212195647/http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/star-wars-roger-christian|archive-date=December 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Lucas also wanted the spaceships to look "cobbled together, as opposed to a sleek monoshape."<ref>''Star Wars Archives: Episodes IV-VI'', from Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Fox, 2011)</ref> Barry said that the director "wants to make it look like it's shot on location on your average everyday Death Star or Mos Eisley Spaceport or local cantina."

Nothing was new. George was going right against that."<ref name=EsquireRC/>

Although Lucas initially provided funds using his earnings from ''American Graffiti'', it was inadequate. As they could not afford to dress the sets, Christian was forced to use unconventional methods and materials to achieve the desired look. He suggested that Lucas use [[scrap]] in making the dressings, and the director agreed.<ref name=EsquireRC/> Christian said, "I've always had this idea. I used to do it with models when I was a kid. I'd stick things on them and we'd make things look old."<ref name=DOFRC/> Barry, Christian, and their team began designing the props and sets at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]].<ref name="ASCbehind2"/>

According to Christian, the ''Millennium Falcon'' set was the most difficult to build. Christian wanted the interior of the ''Falcon'' to look like that of a submarine.<ref name=EsquireRC/> He found scrap airplane metal "that no one wanted in those days and bought them."<ref name=DOFRC/> He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces, giving him the chance to "stick it in the sets in specific ways."<ref name=EsquireRC/> It took him several weeks to finish the chess set (which he described as "the most encrusted set") in the hold of the ''Falcon''. The garbage compactor set "was also pretty hard, because I knew I had actors in there and the walls had to come in, and they had to be in dirty water and I had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt them but also not bobbing around."<ref name=EsquireRC/> A total of 30 sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and the Death Star corridors were created; all of the nine sound stages at Elstree were used to accommodate them. The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a second sound stage at [[Shepperton Studios]]; the stage was the largest in Europe at the time.<ref name="ASCbehind2"/>

===Filming===
{{see also|List of Star Wars filming locations}}
In 1975, Lucas formed his own visual effects company [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) after discovering that 20th Century-Fox's visual effects department had been disbanded. ILM began its work on ''Star Wars'' in a warehouse in [[Van Nuys]]. Most of the visual effects used pioneering digital [[motion control photography]] developed by [[John Dykstra]] and his team, which created the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras.<ref name=Dreams/> [[Brian Johnson (special effects artist)|Brian Johnson]] also turned down the opportunity to work on the film because he was busy working on ''[[Space: 1999]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-04-15|title=Brian Johnson|url=https://britishcinematographer.co.uk/brian-johnson/|access-date=2021-05-14|website=British Cinematographer|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Lucas tried "to get a cohesive reality" for his feature. Since the film is a fairy tale, as he had described, "I still wanted it to have an ethereal quality, yet be well composed and, also, have an alien look." He designed the film to have an "extremely bizarre, [[Gregg Toland]]-like surreal look with strange over-exposed colors, a lot of shadows, a lot of hot areas." Lucas wanted ''Star Wars'' to embrace the combination of "strange graphics of fantasy" and "the feel of a documentary" to impress a distinct look. To achieve this, he hired the British cinematographer [[Gilbert Taylor]].<ref name="ASCbehind2"/> Originally, Lucas's first choice for the position was [[Geoffrey Unsworth]], who also provided the cinematography for ''2001: A Space Odyssey''.<ref name="KurtzIGN3"/> Unsworth was interested in working with the director, and initially accepted the job when it was offered to him by Lucas and Kurtz. He eventually withdrew to work on the [[Vincente Minnelli]]-directed ''[[A Matter of Time (film)|A Matter of Time]]'' (1976) instead, which "really annoy[ed]" Kurtz.<ref name="KurtzIGN3"/> Lucas called up for other cinematographers, and eventually chose Taylor, basing his choice on Taylor's cinematography for ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (both 1964). On his decision, Lucas said: "I thought they were good, eccentrically photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor."<ref name="ASCbehind2"/>

Taylor said that Lucas, who was consumed by the details of the complicated production, "avoided all meetings and contact with me from day one, so I read the extra-long script many times and made my own decisions as to how I would shoot the picture."

During production, Lucas and Taylor—whom Kurtz called "old-school" and "crotchety"{{Sfn |Pollock| 1999|pp= 161–162}}—had disputes over filming.<ref name="KurtzIGN3"/> With a background in [[independent film]]making, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who believed that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look.{{Sfn |Pollock| 1999|pp= 161–162}} Kurtz stated that "In a couple of scenes ... rather than saying, 'It looks a bit over lit, can you fix that?', [Lucas would] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.' And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that, I've lit it the way I think it should be—tell me what's the effect that you want, and I'll make a judgment about what to do with my lights.{{'"}}<ref name="KurtzIGN3"/>

Originally, Lucas envisioned the planet of Tatooine, where much of the film would take place, as a [[jungle]] planet. Kurtz traveled to the [[Philippines]] to scout locations; however, because of the idea of spending months filming in the jungle would make Lucas "itchy", the director refined his vision and made Tatooine a [[desert planet]] instead.<ref name="Time77p58">{{cite magazine|last=Clarke|first=Gerald |author-link=Gerald Clarke (author)|date=May 30, 1977|title=Star Wars: The Year's Best Movie|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|volume=109|number=22|page=58}}</ref> Kurtz then researched all American, North African, and [[Middle East]]ern deserts, and found Tunisia, near the [[Sahara]] desert, as the ideal location.<ref name="ASCbehind2"/> Lucas later stated that he had wanted to make it look like outer space.<ref>In Director's commentary of the 2004 DVD edition of ''A New Hope''</ref>

When principal photography began on March 22, 1976, in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on Tatooine, the project faced several problems.{{Sfn|Hearn|2005|p=102}} Lucas fell behind schedule in the first week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns.{{Sfn|Hearn|2005|p=102}}<ref name="Heritage">{{cite magazine|author=Staff|date=May 25, 2006|title=How ''Star Wars'' Surprised the World|magazine=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|publisher=American Heritage Publishing Company |access-date=October 2, 2006|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060525-star-wars-george-lucas-movies-hollywood-luke-skywalker-darth-vader-american-graffiti-science|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611204422/http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060525-star-wars-george-lucas-movies-hollywood-luke-skywalker-darth-vader-american-graffiti-science|archive-date=June 11, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Moreover, a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming. Taylor said, "you couldn't really see where the land ended and the sky began. It was all a gray mess, and the robots were just a blur." Given this situation, Lucas requested heavy [[Photographic filter|filtration]], which Taylor rejected, who said: "I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ... But George saw it differently, so we tried using nets and other diffusion. He asked to set up one shot on the robots with a 300mm, and the sand and sky just mushed together. I told him it wouldn't work, but he said that was the way he wanted to do the entire film, all diffused." This difference was later settled by 20th Century-Fox executives, who backed Taylor's suggestion.<ref name="Taylor4">{{cite web|last=Williams|first=David E.|title=Gilbert Taylor, BSC is given the spotlight with the ASC's International Achievement Award|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/feb06/taylor/page4.html|publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] |access-date=May 14, 2014|date=February 2006|page=4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826032829/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/feb06/taylor/page4.html|archive-date=August 26, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Filming began in [[Chott el Djerid]], while a construction crew in [[Tozeur]] took eight weeks to transform the desert into the desired setting.<ref name="ASCbehind2"/> Other locations included the sand [[dune]]s of the Tunisian desert near [[Nafta, Tunisia|Nafta]], where a scene featuring a giant skeleton of a creature lying in the background as R2-D2 and C-3PO make their way across the sands was filmed.<ref name="ASCbehind3">{{cite magazine|title=A young, enthusiastic crew employs far-out technology to put a rollicking intergalactic fantasy onto the screen|magazine=American Cinematographer|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/starwars/behind/pg3.htm|publisher=American Society of Cinematographers |access-date=May 17, 2014|author=Staff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517122204/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/starwars/behind/pg3.htm |archive-date=May 17, 2014|page=3 |url-status=dead}}</ref> When Daniels wore the C-3PO outfit for the first time in Tunisia, the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot, stabbing him.<ref name="Heritage" /> He also could not see through his costume's eyes, which was covered with gold to prevent corrosion.<ref name="Time77p58" /> Abnormal radio signals caused by the Tunisian sands made the radio-controlled R2-D2 models run out of control.

Lucas chose Hotel Sidi Driss, which is larger than the typical underground dwellings, to shoot the interior of Luke's homestead.<ref name="ASCbehind3"/> Additional scenes for Tatooine were filmed at [[Death Valley]] in North America.<ref name="ASCbehind4">{{cite magazine|title=A young, enthusiastic crew employs far-out technology to put a rollicking intergalactic fantasy onto the screen|magazine=American Cinematographer|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/starwars/behind/pg4.htm |url-status=dead|publisher=American Society of Cinematographers |access-date=May 17, 2014|author=Staff|page=4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517122203/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/starwars/behind/pg4.htm |archive-date=May 17, 2014}}</ref>

After two-and-a-half weeks of filming in Tunisia,<ref name="ASCbehind3"/> production moved to Elstree Studios, near London, to film interior scenes.<ref name="Heritage" /> Elstree was chosen as a studio over other options in Hollywood or elsewhere. ''Star Wars'' required the use of nine different [[sound stage]]s simultaneously, which most studios couldn't accommodate.<ref name="Statesman">{{cite web|title=Starting Star Wars: How George Lucas came to create a galaxy|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2017/05/starting-star-wars-how-george-lucas-came-create-galaxy|website=[[New Statesman]]|date=May 25, 2017 |access-date=2021-03-10 |archive-date=November 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124061718/https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2017/05/starting-star-wars-how-george-lucas-came-create-galaxy |url-status=live}}</ref> Because of stricter working conditions, filming in Britain had to finish by 5:30 pm, unless Lucas was in the middle of a scene.<ref name="BBCTrivia" /> He often made requests for more time to shoot, but they were usually turned down.<ref name="Dreams" />

Despite Lucas's efforts, his crew had little interest in the film. Most of the crew considered the project a "children's film", rarely took their work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous.<ref name="Dreams" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/minisites/starwarslegacy/|title=Star Wars – The Legacy Revealed|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]|date=May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527113855/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=54079&display_order=3&mini_id=54078 |archive-date=May 27, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Actor Baker later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure. Ford found it strange that "there's a princess with weird buns in her hair", and called Chewbacca a "giant in a monkey suit."<ref name="Dreams" />

The Elstree sets designed by John Barry, according to Gilbert Taylor, "were like a coal mine." He said that "they were all black and gray, with really no opportunities for lighting at all." To resolve the problem, he worked the lighting into the sets by chopping in its walls, ceiling and floors. This would result in "a 'cut-out' system of panel lighting", with [[Halogen lamp|quartz lamps]] that could be placed in the holes in the walls, ceiling and floors. His idea was supported by the Fox studio, which agreed that "we couldn't have this '[[Black Hole of Calcutta|black hole of Calcutta]].{{'"}} The lighting approach Taylor devised "allowed George to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting, which gave him more freedom."<ref name="Taylor4"/> In total, the filming in Britain took 14-and-a-half weeks.<ref name="ASCbehind3"/>

[[File:Star Wars in Guatemala 3.jpg|thumb|[[Tikal]], Guatemala, which served as the setting of the Rebel base]]

Lucas commissioned computer programmer [[Larry Cuba]] to create the [[Larry Cuba#Death Star sequence|animated Death Star plans]] shown at the rebel base on [[Yavin 4]]. This was written with the [[GRASS programming language]], exported to a [[Vector General]] [[Vector monitor|monitor]] and filmed on [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]] to be rear-projected on the set. It is the only computer animation in the original version of the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Plesset|first=Ross|title=The Death Star Plans ARE in the Main Computer|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/death-star-plans-are-in-the-main-computer-and-special-postcard|website=StarWars.com |access-date=July 20, 2019|date=December 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719001758/https://www.starwars.com/news/death-star-plans-are-in-the-main-computer-and-special-postcard |archive-date=July 19, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The Yavin scenes were filmed in the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] temples at [[Tikal]], Guatemala. Lucas selected the location as a potential filming site after seeing a poster of it hanging at a [[travel agency]] while he was filming in Britain. This inspired him to send a film crew to Guatemala in March 1977 to shoot scenes. While filming in Tikal, the crew paid locals with a six-pack of beer to watch over the camera equipment for several days.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Mike|title=Maya apocalypse and Star Wars collide in Guatemalan temple|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-maya-calendar-starwars-idUSBRE8BH16120121218|publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date=May 14, 2014|date=December 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517154439/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/18/us-maya-calendar-starwars-idUSBRE8BH16120121218 |archive-date=May 17, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

While shooting, Lucas rarely spoke to the actors, who believed that he expected too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words "faster" and "more intense".<ref name="Dreams" /> Kurtz stated that "it happened a lot where he would just say, 'Let's try it again a little bit faster.' That was about the only instruction he'd give anybody. A lot of actors don't mind—they don't care, they just get on with it. But some actors really need a lot of pampering and a lot of feedback, and if they don't get it, they get paranoid that they might not be doing a good job." Kurtz has said that Lucas "wasn't gregarious, he's very much a loner and very shy, so he didn't like large groups of people, he didn't like working with a large crew, he didn't like working with a lot of actors."<ref name="KurtzIGN3"/>

Ladd offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio; he dealt with scrutiny from board members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts.<ref name="Dreams" /><ref name="Heritage" /> Initially, Fox approved $8&nbsp;million for the project; Gary Kurtz said: "we proceeded to pick a production plan and do a more final budget with a British art department and look for locations in North Africa, and kind of pulled together some things. Then, it was obvious that 8&nbsp;million wasn't going to do it—they had approved 8&nbsp;million." After requests from the team that "it had to be more," the executives "got a bit scared."<ref name="KurtzIGN3"/> For two weeks, Lucas and his crew "didn't really do anything except kind of pull together new budget figures." At the same time, after production fell behind schedule, Ladd told Lucas he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. Kurtz said that "it came out to be like 9.8 or .9 or something like that, and in the end they just said, 'Yes, that's okay, we'll go ahead.{{'"}}<ref name="KurtzIGN3"/> The crew split into three units, with those units led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor [[Robert Watts]]. Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.<ref name="Dreams"/><ref name="Heritage"/>

Lucas had to write around a scene featuring a human Jabba the Hutt, which was scrapped due to budget and time constraints.<ref>George Lucas commentary, ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', Special Edition, dir. George Lucas, (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004).</ref> Lucas would later claim he wanted to superimpose a [[stop-motion]] creature over the actor—which he did with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#Jabba the Hutt|in the 1997 Special Edition]].{{Sfn|Hearn|2005|p=109}}{{Sfn|Rinzler|2007|p=256}} All of the original script drafts describe Jabba as humanoid, with the notion of him being an alien not coming up until work on the 1979 re-release.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kaminski|first=Michael|title=Jabba the Hutt: "Wonderful Human Being"|url=http://fd.noneinc.com/secrethistoryofstarwarscom/secrethistoryofstarwars.com/jabba.html |access-date=November 19, 2020|website=The Secret History of Star Wars |archive-date=November 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111185345/http://fd.noneinc.com/secrethistoryofstarwarscom/secrethistoryofstarwars.com/jabba.html|url-status=live|date=September 15, 2008a}}</ref> According to [[Greedo]] actor [[Paul Blake (actor)|Paul Blake]], his own character was created as a result of Lucas having to cut the Jabba scene.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carbone|first=Gina|title=Greedo Actor Is Confused By 'Maclunkey,' And Star Wars In General|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484984/greedo-actor-is-confused-by-maclunkey-and-star-wars-in-general|website=Cinema Blend |access-date=November 17, 2019|date=November 17, 2019}}</ref>

During production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile, as he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with [[hypertension]] and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level.<ref name="Dreams" /><ref name="Heritage" /> [[Post-production]] was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century-Fox. Moreover, Hamill's car accident left his face visibly scarred, which restricted re-shoots.<ref name="Heritage" />

===Post-production===
[[File:Steven Spielberg by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Steven Spielberg]] said he was the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film in its early cut screening.]]

''Star Wars'' was originally slated for release on Christmas 1976; however, its production delays pushed the film's release to mid-1977.{{sfn|Taylor|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uG0uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT116 116]}} Editor [[John Jympson]] began cutting the film together while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia; as Lucas noted, the editor was in an "impossible position" because Lucas had not explained any of the film's material to him. When Lucas watched Jympson's rough cut for the first time, he disliked what he saw. [[J.&nbsp;W. Rinzler]] wrote that "Jympson's selection of takes was questionable, and he seemed to be having trouble doing match-cuts." Lucas was prepared to give Jympson more time; Jympson disliked Lucas's working style.<ref>{{harvnb|Rinzler|2007|p=194}}</ref> As production went on, Lucas still disapproved of Jympson's cut and fired him halfway through the film's production. He commented: "Unfortunately it didn't work out. It's very hard when you are hiring people to know if they are going to mesh with you and if you are going to get what you want. In the end, I don't think he fully understood the movie and what I was trying to do. I shoot in a very peculiar way, in a documentary style, and it takes a lot of hard editing to make it work."<ref>{{harvnb|Rinzler|2007|p=213}}</ref> After attempting to persuade Jympson to cut the film his way, Lucas replaced him with [[Paul Hirsch (film editor)|Paul Hirsch]], [[Richard Chew]], and his then-wife, [[Marcia Lucas]], who was also cutting the film ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]'' (1977) with Lucas's friend [[Martin Scorsese]]. Richard Chew considered the film to have been cut in a slow, by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in [[master shot]]s that flowed into [[close-up]] coverage. He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts. Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously.<ref name="Dreams" />

Jympson's original [[Rough cut|assembly]] contained a large amount of footage which differed from the [[Final cut privilege|final cut]] of the film, including several alternate takes and a number of [[deleted scene|scenes which were subsequently deleted]] to improve the narrative pace. The most significant material cut was a series of scenes from the first part of the film which introduced Luke Skywalker. These early scenes, set in Anchorhead on the planet Tatooine, presented the audience with Luke's everyday life among his friends as it is affected by the space battle above the planet; they also introduced the character of Biggs Darklighter, Luke's closest friend who departs to join the rebellion.<ref name=Taraldsvik>{{cite book|last1=Taraldsvik|first1=Morten Schive|title=A Sci-Fi Movie Lexicon III|publisher=Lulu|isbn=9781445264653 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Scr6AQAAQBAJ&pg=PT109 |access-date=April 23, 2015|chapter=Star Wars IV: A New Hope: Lost Scenes |archive-date=August 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819212941/https://books.google.com/books?id=Scr6AQAAQBAJ&pg=PT109 |url-status=live}}</ref> Chew explained the rationale behind removing these scenes as a narrative decision: "In the first five minutes, we were hitting everybody with more information than they could handle. There were too many story lines to keep straight: the robots and the Princess, Vader, Luke. So we simplified it by taking out Luke and Biggs."{{Sfn |Rinzler| 2007|p = 255}} In an examination of this early cut, which has come to be called the "Lost Cut", David West Reynolds noted the film adopted a "documentary-like" approach that emphasized "clarity, especially in geographic and spatial relationships" over "dramatic or artistic concerns". As a result, the film was more "leisurely paced".<ref name="Lost Cut">{{cite journal|last1=Reynolds|first1=David West|title=The Evolution of Star Wars: Exploring the Lost Cut|journal=[[Star Wars Insider]]|date=December 1998|issue=41|pages=69–75}}</ref> Reynolds estimated this early cut contained "30–40%" different footage from the final cut, with most of the differences coming from extended cuts or alternate takes rather than deleted scenes.<ref name="Lost Cut" />

After viewing a rough cut, Alan Ladd likened the early Anchorhead scenes to "''American Graffiti'' in outer space". Lucas was looking for a way of accelerating the storytelling, and removing Luke's early scenes would distinguish ''Star Wars'' from his earlier teenage drama and "get that ''American Graffiti'' feel out of it".<ref name=Taraldsvik/> Lucas also stated that he wanted to move the narrative focus to C-3PO and R2-D2: "At the time, to have the first half-hour of the film be mainly about robots was a bold idea."{{Sfn|Hearn|2005|p=106}}{{Sfn | Brooker| 2009|p = 18}}

Meanwhile, Industrial Light & Magic was struggling to achieve unprecedented [[special effect]]s. The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.<ref name="Heritage" /> With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining, ILM was forced to finish a year's work in six months. Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial [[dogfight]]s from old war films, which enhanced the pacing of the scenes.<ref name="Dreams" />

Burtt had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an "organic soundtrack". Blaster sounds were a modified recording of a steel cable, under tension, being struck. The lightsaber sound effect was developed by Burtt as a combination of the hum of idling [[Movie projector#Automation and the rise of the multiplex|interlock motors]] in aged [[movie projector]]s and interference caused by a television set on a shieldless [[microphone]]. Burtt discovered the latter accidentally as he was looking for a buzzing, sparking sound to add to the projector-motor hum.<ref>{{citation|author=Burtt, Ben|title=Star Wars Trilogy: The Definitive Collection|publisher=Lucasfilm|medium=Laserdisc|quote=...the microphone passed right behind the picture tube and as it did, this particular microphone produced an unusual hum. It picked up a transmission from the television set and a signal was induced into its sound reproducing mechanism, and that was a great buzz, actually. So I took that buzz and recorded it with the projector motor sound and that fifty-fifty kind of combination of those two sounds became the basic Lightsaber tone.|year=1993|author-link=Ben Burtt}}</ref> For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences. Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of R2-D2 by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer. Darth Vader's breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a [[scuba set|scuba]] regulator implanted with a microphone,<ref name="silicon">{{cite web|url=http://www.transmitmedia.com/svr/burtt/index.html|title=Interview with Benn Burtt|publisher=Silicon Valley Radio |access-date=October 3, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811231156/http://www.transmitmedia.com/svr/burtt/index.html | archive-date=August 11, 2018 | url-status=dead}}</ref> which began the idea of Vader having been a burn-victim, which had not been the case during production.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kaminski|first=Michael|date=2007|title=The Visual Development of Darth Vader|website=The Secret History of Star Wars|url=http://fd.noneinc.com/secrethistoryofstarwarscom/secrethistoryofstarwars.com/visualdevelopmentofdarthvader.html|access-date=November 19, 2020|archive-date=November 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112034852/http://fd.noneinc.com/secrethistoryofstarwarscom/secrethistoryofstarwars.com/visualdevelopmentofdarthvader.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 1977, Lucas screened an early cut of the film for Fox executives, several director friends, along with [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Howard Chaykin]] of [[Marvel Comics]] who were preparing a [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|''Star Wars'' comic book]]. The cut had a different crawl from the finished version and used Prowse's voice for Darth Vader. It also lacked most special effects; hand-drawn arrows took the place of blaster beams, and when the ''Millennium Falcon'' fought TIE fighters, the film cut to footage of [[World War II]] dogfights.<ref name="thomas20070601">{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/bts/article/f20070601/index.html?page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326072227/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/bts/article/f20070601/index.html|title=Star Wars: The Comic Book That Saved Marvel!|website=[[Star Wars|StarWars.com]]|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|date=June 1, 2007 |access-date=December 5, 2012|author=Thomas, Roy |archive-date=March 26, 2010}}</ref> The reactions of the directors present, such as Brian De Palma, [[John Milius]], and Steven Spielberg, disappointed Lucas. Spielberg, who said he was the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film, believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects. Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film. In contrast, Ladd and the other studio executives loved the film; [[Gareth Wigan]] told Lucas: "This is the greatest film I've ever seen" and cried during the screening. Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any approval from studio executives before.<ref name="Dreams" /> The delays increased the budget from $8&nbsp;million to $11&nbsp;million.<ref name="TheNumbers">{{cite the numbers|id=Star-Wars-Ep-IV-A-New-Hope|title=Star Wars Ep.

With the project $2 million over budget, Lucas was forced to make numerous artistic compromises to complete ''Star Wars''. Ladd reluctantly agreed to release an extra $20,000 funding and in early 1977 [[second unit]] filming completed a number of sequences including exterior desert shots for Tatooine in Death Valley and [[China Lake Acres, California|China Lake Acres]] in California, and exterior Yavin jungle shots in Guatemala, along with additional studio footage to complete the Mos Eisley Cantina sequence.

On the recommendation of Spielberg, Lucas hired [[John Williams]], who had worked with Spielberg on the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', for which he won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. Lucas originally hired Williams to consult on music editing choices and to compose the source music for the music, telling Williams that he intended to use extant music.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Ross|first=Alex|date=July 21, 2020|title=The Force Is Still Strong with John Williams|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-force-is-still-strong-with-john-williams|website=New Yorker|access-date=November 19, 2020|archive-date=November 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101005324/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-force-is-still-strong-with-john-williams|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Star Wars Liner Notes, 1977.</ref> Lucas believed that the film would portray visually foreign worlds, but that a grand musical score would give the audience an emotional familiarity. Therefore, Lucas assembled his favorite orchestral pieces for the soundtrack, until Williams convinced him that an original score would be unique and more unified, having viewed Lucas's music choices as a temp track. However, a few of Williams's eventual pieces were influenced by the temp track: the "Main Title Theme" was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film ''[[Kings Row]]'', scored by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]];<ref>{{Cite book|title=The encyclopedia of film composers|last=Hischak, Thomas S.|isbn=9781442245501|location=Lanham, Maryland|oclc=908031206|date=April 16, 2015}}</ref> and the track "Dune Sea of Tatooine" drew from the soundtrack of ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', scored by [[Alessandro Cicognini]]. Lucas would later deny having ever conceived using extant music for the film.<ref name=":3" />

In March 1977, Williams conducted the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] to record the ''Star Wars'' soundtrack in 12 days.<ref name="Dreams">''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''.

[2004]</ref> The original soundtrack was released as a double LP in 1977 by [[20th Century Fox Records|20th Century Records]]. 20th Century Records also released ''[[The Story of Star Wars]]'' that year, a narrated [[audio drama]] adaptation of the film utilizing some of its original music, dialogue, and sound effects. The [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores|list of best film scores]] ranks the ''Star Wars'' soundtrack at number one.<ref name="AFIscore" />

According to Lucas, different concepts of the film were inspired by numerous sources, such as [[Beowulf]] and [[King Arthur]] for the origins of myth and religion.<ref name="Dreams" /> Lucas had originally intended to remake the 1930s ''Flash Gordon'' film serials but was unable to obtain the rights; thus, he resorted to drawing from [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1958 film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' and, allegedly, Joseph Campbell's ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces''.<ref name="FlashG" /><ref name="InspirationsLucas">{{cite news|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=10 films that influenced Star Wars|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/star-wars/10817059/10-films-that-influenced-Star-Wars.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=May 10, 2014|date=May 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510060624/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/star-wars/10817059/10-films-that-influenced-Star-Wars.html|archive-date=May 10, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Star Wars'' features many elements derived from ''Flash Gordon'', such as the conflict between rebels and Imperial Forces, the [[wipe (transition)|wipes]] between scenes, the fusion of futuristic technology and traditional mythology, and the famous opening crawl that begins each film.<ref name="InspirationsLucas" /><ref name="Insp2">{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Christopher|title='Star Wars,' 'Speed' And Other Movies Inspired By Akira Kurosawa On His 100th Birthday|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/03/23/star-wars-speed-and-other-movies-inspired-by-akira-kurosawa-on-his-100th-birthday/|publisher=MTV |access-date=May 10, 2014|date=March 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011002911/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/03/23/star-wars-speed-and-other-movies-inspired-by-akira-kurosawa-on-his-100th-birthday/|archive-date=October 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The film has also been compared to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref name="Cineman Syndicate">{{cite journal|title=Star Wars (1977)|journal=Cineman Syndicate|date=February 14, 1997}}</ref><ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite magazine|last1=Scanlon|first1=Paul|title=George Lucas: The Wizard of 'Star Wars'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-wizard-of-star-wars-20120504|magazine=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner |access-date=May 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519071645/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-wizard-of-star-wars-20120504|archive-date=May 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The influence of ''The Hidden Fortress'' can be seen in the relationship between C-3PO and R2-D2, which evolved from the two bickering peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, and a Japanese family crest seen in the earlier film is similar to the Imperial Crest. ''Star Wars'' also borrows heavily from another Kurosawa film, ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961).<ref name="InspirationsLucas" /> In both films, several men threaten the hero, bragging about how wanted they are by the authorities, and have an arm being cut off by a blade; Kuwabatake Sanjuro (played by Toshiro Mifune) is offered "twenty-five ryo now, twenty-five when you complete the mission", whereas Han Solo is offered "Two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan." Its sequel ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962) also inspired the hiding-under-the-floor trick featured in the film.<ref name="InspirationsLucas" /> Another source of influence was ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), which inspired the film's visual approach, including long-lens desert shots. There are also thematic parallels, including the freedom fight by a rebel army against an empire, and politicians who meddle behind the scenes.<ref name="InspirationsLucas" />

Tatooine is similar to the desert planet of [[Arrakis]] from [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series. Arrakis is the only known source of a [[Melange (fictional drug)|longevity spice]]; ''Star Wars'' makes references to spice in "the spice mines of Kessel", and a spice freighter. Other similarities include those between Princess Leia and Princess Alia, and [[Jedi mind trick]]s and "The Voice", a controlling ability used by the [[Bene Gesserit]]. In passing, Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are "moisture farmers"; in ''Dune'', dew collectors are used by [[Fremen]] to "provide a small but reliable source of water."<ref>{{cite web|work=D. A.

The Death Star assault scene was modeled after the [[List of World War II films|World War II film]] ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1955), in which [[Royal Air Force]] [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim [[bouncing bomb]]s at dams, [[Operation Chastise|to cripple]] the heavy industry of Germany's [[Ruhr]] region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-the-dam-busters|title=The Cinema Behind Star Wars: The Dam Busters|date=December 9, 2013|website=StarWars.com |access-date=January 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120093604/https://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-the-dam-busters |archive-date=January 20, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Some of the dialogue in ''The Dam Busters'' is repeated in the ''Star Wars'' climax; Gilbert Taylor also filmed the special effects sequences in ''The Dam Busters''.

The opening shot of ''Star Wars'', in which a detailed spaceship fills the screen overhead, is a reference to the scene introducing the interplanetary spacecraft ''[[Discovery One]]'' in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s seminal 1968 film ''2001: A Space Odyssey''. The earlier big-budget [[science fiction film]] influenced the look of ''Star Wars'' in many other ways, including the use of [[extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] pods and hexagonal corridors.

==Marketing==
[[File:Star wars 1977 us.svg|thumb|Rendition of Dan Perri's original ''Star Wars'' logotype]]
While the film was in production, a logo was commissioned from [[Dan Perri]], a [[film title design|title sequence designer]] who had worked on the titles for films such as ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973) and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976). Perri devised a [[foreshortening|foreshortened]] ''STAR WARS'' [[logotype]] consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a [[vanishing point]]. This logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the film's opening crawl. In the end, Perri's logo was not used for the film's opening title sequence, although it was used widely on pre-release print advertising and on cinema [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]].{{sfn|Taylor|2015|loc=Chapter 11}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars (1977)|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/|website=Art of the Title |access-date=June 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402074725/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/star-wars/ |archive-date=April 2, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The logotype eventually selected for on-screen use originated in a promotional brochure that was distributed by Fox to cinema owners in 1976. This brochure was designed by [[Suzy Rice]], a young art director at the [[Los Angeles]] [[advertising agency]] Seiniger Advertising. On a visit to ILM in Van Nuys, Rice was instructed by Lucas to produce a logo that would intimidate the viewer, and he reportedly asked for the logo to appear "very [[fascism|fascist]]" in style. Rice's response to her brief was to use an outlined, modified [[Helvetica|Helvetica Black]]. After some feedback from Lucas, Rice decided to join the ''S'' and ''T'' of ''STAR'' and the ''R'' and ''S'' of ''WARS''. Lucas signed off on the brochure in between takes while filming inserts for the Mos Eisley Cantina scene. Gary Kurtz was impressed with Rice's logo and selected it over Perri's design for the film's opening titles, after modifying the letter ''W'' to flatten the pointed tips originally designed by Rice. This finalized the design of one of the most recognizable logos in cinema design, although Rice's contribution was not credited in the film.{{sfn|Taylor|2015|loc=Chapter 11}}

For the US release in 1977, 20th Century-Fox commissioned a promotional [[film poster]] from the advertising agency Smolen, Smith and Connolly. They used the freelance artist [[Tom Jung]] who was given the brief of "good over evil." His poster, known as [[:File:StarWarsMoviePoster1977.jpg|''Style ‘A’'']], depicted Luke Skywalker standing in a heroic pose, brandishing a shining lightsaber above his head, with Princess Leia below him, and a large, ghostly image of Darth Vader's helmet looming behind them. Some Fox executives considered this poster "too dark" and commissioned the [[Brothers Hildebrandt]], a pair of well-known [[Fantastic art|fantasy artists]], to rework the poster for the UK release. When the film opened in British theaters, the Hildebrandts' [[:File:Bros Hildebrandt Star Wars quad poster.jpg|''Style ‘B’'' poster]] was used in cinema [[billboard]]s. Fox and [[Lucasfilm]] subsequently decided that they wanted to promote the new film with a less [[stylized]] and more [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] depiction of the lead characters. Producer Gary Kurtz turned to the film poster artist [[Tom Chantrell]], who was already well known for his prolific work for [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer horror films]], and commissioned a new version. Two months after ''Star Wars'' opened, the Hildebrandts' poster was replaced by Chantrell's [[:File:Tom Chantrell Star Wars quad poster 1977.jpg|''Style ‘C’'' poster]] in UK cinemas.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sansweet|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Vilmur|first2=Peter|title=The Star Wars poster book|date=2005|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780811848831}}</ref><ref name="photosecrets">{{cite web|title=Evolution of the Star Wars Poster|url=https://www.photosecrets.com/evolution-of-the-star-wars-poster.html|publisher=PhotoSecrets.com |access-date=July 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728144712/https://www.photosecrets.com/evolution-of-the-star-wars-poster.html |archive-date=July 28, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dass|first1=William|title=The History of Star Wars Posters|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/star-wars-the-posters-14ad09654325/|website=[[Film School Rejects]] |access-date=July 30, 2017|date=December 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619164922/https://filmschoolrejects.com/star-wars-the-posters-14ad09654325/|archive-date=June 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A short history of the first British Star Wars posters|url=http://www.sci-fimovieposters.co.uk/british-star-wars-posters.htm|publisher=SciFiMoviePosters.co.uk |access-date=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160624/http://www.sci-fimovieposters.co.uk/british-star-wars-posters.htm|archive-date=August 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Charles Lippincott was the marketing director for ''Star Wars''. As 20th Century-Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing [[T-shirt]]s and posters, Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere. He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation, and with [[Del Rey Books]] for a novelization. A fan of science fiction, he used his contacts to promote the film at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] and elsewhere within [[science-fiction fandom]].<ref name="Dreams"/><ref name="KurtzIGN1"/>

==Release==
[[File:The queue outside Leicester Square Theatre.jpg|thumb|A crowd outside [[Leicester Square Theatre]] the day after the film's premiere.]]
While initially being released only in a limited theatrical run, ''Star Wars'' was an unprecedented success for 20th Century-Fox, soon becoming a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] hit and expanding to a much wider release. It would eventually see many theatrical and home video re-releases.

===Premiere and initial release===
Worried that ''Star Wars'' would be beaten out by other summer films, such as ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'', 20th Century-Fox moved the release date to May 25, the Wednesday before [[Memorial Day]]. However, only 37 theaters ordered the film to be shown in North America. In response, the studio demanded that theaters order ''Star Wars'' if they wanted the eagerly anticipated [[The Other Side of Midnight (film)|''The Other Side of Midnight'']] based on [[Sidney Sheldon]]'s 1973 [[The Other Side of Midnight|novel by the same name]].<ref name="Dreams"/>

''Star Wars'' debuted on Wednesday, May 25, 1977, in fewer than 32 theaters, and eight more on Thursday and Friday. Kurtz said in 2002, "That would be laughable today."

After visiting the set of the Steven Spielberg film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', Lucas was sure ''Close Encounters'' would outperform the yet-to-be-released ''Star Wars'' at the box office. Spielberg disagreed, and believed ''Star Wars'' would be the bigger hit. Lucas proposed they trade 2.5% of the profit on each other's films; Spielberg took the trade, and still receives 2.5% of the profits from ''Star Wars''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/george-lucas-star-wars-bet-made-steven-spielberg-millions-2014-3?op=1|title=How Steven Spielberg Made Millions Off 'Star Wars' After A 1977 Bet With George Lucas|magazine=Business Insider |access-date=March 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131235102/http://www.businessinsider.com/george-lucas-star-wars-bet-made-steven-spielberg-millions-2014-3 |archive-date=January 31, 2018}}</ref>

Amidst Fox pessimism, Lucas elected to forgo his option to an extra $500,000 fee for directing ''Star Wars'', in exchange for obtaining the merchandising and sequel rights for the movie from Fox.<ref name="Force-Seabrook-NewYorker-1997">{{cite magazine|title=Why Is the Force Still with Us?|first=John|last=Seabrook|date=December 30, 1997|magazine=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/01/06/why-is-the-force-still-with-us |access-date=Dec 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725155722/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/01/06/why-is-the-force-still-with-us |archive-date=July 25, 2019 |url-status=live}} <br /> "Lucas's most significant business decision—one that seemed laughable to the Fox executives at the time—was to forgo his option to receive an additional five-hundred-thousand-dollar fee from Fox for directing “Star Wars” and to take the merchandising and sequel rights instead."</ref>
''The Other Side of Midnight'' was supposed to be the studio's big summer hit, while Lucas's movie was considered the "B track" for theater owners nationwide. While Fox requested [[Mann's Chinese Theatre]], the studio promised that the film needed only two weeks.<ref name="THRcover">{{cite magazine|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/star-wars-flashback-no-theater-846864|title='Star Wars' Flashback: When No Theater Wanted to Show the Movie in 1977|first=Pamela|last=McClintock|magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 9, 2015 |access-date=December 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212054035/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/star-wars-flashback-no-theater-846864|archive-date=December 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Fearing that the film would fail, Lucas had made plans to be in Hawaii with his wife Marcia. Having forgotten that the film would open that day,{{r|Biskind}} he spent most of Wednesday in a sound studio in Los Angeles. When Lucas went out for lunch with Marcia, they encountered a long line of people along the sidewalks leading to Mann's Chinese Theatre, waiting to see ''Star Wars''.<ref name="Heritage" /> He was still skeptical of the film's success, even with enthusiastic reports from Ladd and the studio. While in Hawaii, it was not until he watched [[Walter Cronkite]] discuss the gigantic crowds for ''Star Wars'' on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' that Lucas realized he had become very wealthy. Francis Ford Coppola, who needed money to finish ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', sent a telegram to Lucas's hotel asking for funding.{{r|Biskind}} Even technical crew members, such as model makers, were asked for autographs, and cast members became instant household names;<ref name="Dreams" /> when Ford visited a record store to buy an album, enthusiastic fans tore half his shirt off.{{r|Biskind}}

The film was a huge success for 20th Century-Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price had doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century-Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.<ref name="Dreams" />

Although the film's cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success, Ladd became anxious during the premiere in Japan.

====Special Edition====

After ILM began to create CGI for Steven Spielberg's 1993 film ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', Lucas decided that digital technology had caught up to his "original vision" for ''Star Wars''.<ref name="Dreams" /> For the film's 20th anniversary in 1997, ''Star Wars'' was digitally remastered with some altered scenes and re-released to theaters, along with ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', under the campaign title ''Star Wars'' Trilogy: Special Edition. This version of the film runs 124 minutes.

The Special Edition contains visual shots and scenes that were unachievable in the original release due to financial, technological, and time constraints; one such scene involves a meeting between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt.<ref name="Dreams" /> The process of creating the new visual effects for ''Star Wars'' was featured in the documentary film, ''[[Special Effects: Anything Can Happen]]'', directed by ''Star Wars'' sound designer [[Ben Burtt]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kwinn|first=Ann|title=Special Effects: Anything Can Happen|url=http://www.boxoffice.com/reviews/2008-08-special-effects?q=John+Lithgow|work=[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]]|publisher=Boxoffice Media |access-date=May 20, 2014|date=July 4, 1996|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521032352/http://www.boxoffice.com/reviews/2008-08-special-effects?q=John+Lithgow |archive-date=May 21, 2014}}</ref> Although most changes are minor or cosmetic in nature, many fans and critics believe that Lucas degraded the film with the additions.<ref name="Changes">{{cite web|publisher=DVDActive.com|title=Star Wars: The Changes|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-one.html |access-date=September 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223003329/http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-one.html |archive-date=December 23, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Sagers, Aaron, [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/987468611.html?dids=987468611:987468611 "An unbelievable day in the life of Jack Bauer"], ''[[The Morning Call]]'', February 15, 2006</ref><ref name="Restoring Star Wars">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-14/restoring-star-wars/6994818|title=Restoring Star Wars|work=ABC News |access-date=December 18, 2015|date=December 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124070713/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-14/restoring-star-wars/6994818|archive-date=January 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Doesn't Want You">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/the-star-wars-george-lucas-doesnt-want-you-to-see/379184/|title=The Star Wars George Lucas Doesn't Want You To See|date=August 27, 2014|first=Rose|last=Eveleth|magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=November 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828030602/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/the-star-wars-george-lucas-doesnt-want-you-to-see/379184/|archive-date=August 28, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> A particularly controversial change in which a bounty hunter named Greedo shoots first when confronting Han Solo has inspired T-shirts bearing the phrase "[[Han shot first|Han Shot First]]."<ref name="HSF">{{cite web|website=StarWars.com|publisher=Lucasfilm|title=Exclusive T-shirts to Commemorate DVD Release|url=https://www.starwars.com/collecting/shop/shopnews/news20060503.html |access-date=August 14, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902034847/http://starwars.com/collecting/shop/shopnews/news20060503.html |archive-date=September 2, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://collider.com/star-wars-blu-ray-changes-2/112594/|title=More Changes to STAR WARS Include Blinking Ewoks and Different Cut of Greedo Shooting First |access-date=September 19, 2011|date=September 1, 2011|magazine=Collider|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110925081226/http://collider.com/star-wars-blu-ray-changes-2/112594|archive-date = September 25, 2011|url-status = live}}</ref><ref name="hanshootsfirst.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.hanshootsfirst.org/| url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316025904/http://www.hanshootsfirst.org/ |archive-date=March 16, 2012|title=Han Shoots First |access-date=December 26, 2015}}</ref>

''Star Wars'' required extensive recovery of misplaced footage and restoration of the whole film before Lucas's Special Edition modifications could be attempted. It was discovered that in addition to the negative motion picture stocks commonly used on feature films, Lucas had also used Color Reversal [[Internegative]] (CRI) film, a reversal stock subsequently discontinued by Kodak. CRI proved to deteriorate faster than negative stocks did, although it theoretically was of higher quality, as it saved two generations (an interpositive followed by an internegative), where employed. Because of this, the entire composited negative had to be disassembled, and the CRI portions cleaned separately from the negative portions. Once the cleaning was complete, the film was scanned into the computer for restoration. In many cases, entire scenes had to be reconstructed from their individual elements. Digital compositing technology allowed the restorers to correct for problems such as misalignment of mattes and "blue-spill."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/sped/ssws/pg1.htm|title=Saving the Star Wars Saga – page 1|publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] |access-date=February 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921225101/http://www.theasc.com/magazine/starwars/articles/sped/ssws/pg1.htm |archive-date=September 21, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Critical response===
{{quote box

|quote=What makes the ''Star Wars'' experience unique, though, is that it happens on such an innocent and often funny level. It's usually violence that draws me so deeply into a movie—violence ranging from the psychological torment of a [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]] character to the mindless crunch of [[Jaws (film)|a shark's jaws]]. Maybe movies that scare us find the most direct route to our imaginations. But there's hardly any violence at all in ''Star Wars'' (and even then it's presented as essentially bloodless swashbuckling). Instead, there's entertainment so direct and simple that all of the complications of the modern movie seem to vaporize.

''Star Wars'' received critical acclaim. In his 1977 review, [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called the film "an out-of-body experience," compared its special effects to those of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', and opined that the true strength of the film was its "pure narrative".<ref name="Ebert">{{cite web|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=Sun-Times Media Group|last=Ebert|first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert|date=1977<!--The review date was not "January 1, 1977" because the movie came out in May-->|title=''Star Wars''|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/star-wars-1977 |access-date=September 6, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430064749/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/star-wars-1977 |archive-date=April 30, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure" and "the most elaborate, most expensive, most beautiful movie serial ever made".<ref>{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby|date=May 26, 1977|title=''Star Wars'' – A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny...|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/052677wars.html |access-date=October 4, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424081519/http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/052677wars.html |archive-date=April 24, 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> A.D.

==Legacy==
''Star Wars'' launched the careers of many of the film's actors, including Hamill, Ford, Fisher, Mayhew, Daniels, and Jones.<ref name="Dreams" /> Ford, who subsequently starred in [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|the ''Indiana Jones'' series]] (1981–present), ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), and ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985) after working on the film, told the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that ''Star Wars'' "boosted my career", and said, "I think the great luck of my career is that I've made these family movies which are introduced to succeeding generations of kids by their families at the time it seems appropriate."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ford: Star Wars boosted my career|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/ford-star-wars-boosted-my-career-1687514|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |access-date=May 20, 2014|date=May 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611065916/http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/ford-star-wars-boosted-my-career-1687514|archive-date=June 11, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

The film also spawned the ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', which debuted on [[CBS]] on November 17, 1978 and is often considered a failure; Lucas himself disowned it.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=TV Party|title=Star Wars on TV|url=http://www.tvparty.com/70starwars.html |access-date=September 2, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524104154/http://www.tvparty.com/70starwars.html |archive-date=May 24, 2005 |url-status=live}}</ref> The special has never been aired after its original broadcast, and it has never been officially released on home video.

===Cinematic influence===
Ebert wrote in his book ''[[The Great Movies]]'', "Like ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' and ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''Star Wars'' was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after." It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, [[high-concept]] genre for filmmakers to build upon.<ref name="Legacy" /> Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's ''Jaws'', it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] for younger audiences.<ref name="Dreams" /><ref name="GreatEbert">{{cite web|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=Sun-Times Media Group|last=Ebert|first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert|date=June 28, 1999|title=Great Movies: Star Wars|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope-1977 |access-date=October 1, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413113345/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope-1977 |archive-date=April 13, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Shone">[[Tom Shone|Shone, Tom]] (2004).

Jackson used the concept for his production of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]] to add a sense of realism and believability.<ref name="Legacy" /> Christopher Nolan cited ''Star Wars'' as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film, ''[[Inception]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Christopher Nolan's Star Wars Inspiration|url=http://hub.contactmusic.com/news/christopher-nolans-star-wars-inspiration_1153625|website=ContactMusic.com|date=July 16, 2010 |access-date=September 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219064444/http://hub.contactmusic.com/news/christopher-nolans-star-wars-inspiration_1153625 |archive-date=December 19, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Recognition===
In its May 30, 1977 issue, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] named ''Star Wars'' the "Movie of the Year." The publication said it was a "big early supporter" of the vision which would become ''Star Wars''. In an article intended for the cover of the issue, ''Time''{{'}}s [[Gerald Clarke (author)|Gerald Clarke]] wrote that ''Star Wars'' is "a grand and glorious film that may well be the smash hit of 1977, and certainly is the best movie of the year so far. The result is a remarkable confection: a subliminal history of the movies, wrapped in a riveting tale of suspense and adventure, ornamented with some of the most ingenious special effects ever contrived for film." Each of the subsequent films of the ''Star Wars'' saga has appeared on the magazine's cover.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Corliss|first=Richard|title=Star Wars Turns 35: How TIME Covered the Film Phenomenon|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/25/happy-35th-anniversary-star-wars/|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |access-date=May 10, 2014|date=May 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601173454/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/25/happy-35th-anniversary-star-wars/|archive-date=June 1, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

The novelization of the film was published as ''[[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker]]'' in December 1976, six months before the film was released.

Marketing director Charles Lippincott secured the deal with Del Rey Books to publish the novelization in November 1976. By February 1977, a half million copies had been sold.<ref name="Dreams" /> Foster also wrote the sequel novel ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' (1978) to be adapted as a low-budget film if ''Star Wars'' was not a financial success.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wenz|first=John|title=The First Star Wars sequel: Inside the writing of Splinter of the Mind's Eye|url=https://syfy.com/syfywire/the-first-star-wars-sequel-inside-the-writing-of-splinter-of-the-minds-eye|work=Syfy|publisher=SyFy Channel|date=January 1, 2018 |access-date=February 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930231749/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-first-star-wars-sequel-inside-the-writing-of-splinter-of-the-minds-eye|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

22 years after the release of ''Star Wars'', Lucas wrote and directed the prequel trilogy, consisting of the films ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''Revenge of the Sith'' (2005). The films chronicle the history between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter's fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader. The prequel trilogy was financially successful, and polarized critics and fans on their release for the storylines and some new characters.<ref name="IndependentPrequels">{{cite web|first=Clarisse|last=Loughrey|title=Phantom menaces: Why the Star Wars prequels finally deserve some respect|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/star-wars-revenge-sith-anniversary-prequels-defence-anakin-padme-a9519701.html|website=[[The Independent]]|date=May 19, 2020 |access-date=June 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605145321/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/star-wars-revenge-sith-anniversary-prequels-defence-anakin-padme-a9519701.html |archive-date=June 5, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ScreenRantPrequels">{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Bacon|title=Sequels vs. Prequels: Which Star Wars Trilogy Is Better|url=https://screenrant.com/star-wars-sequel-prequel-trilogies-comparison-better/|website=[[Screen Rant]]|date=December 7, 2020 |access-date=June 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201217033234/https://screenrant.com/star-wars-sequel-prequel-trilogies-comparison-better/ |archive-date=December 17, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="GuardianPrequels">{{cite web|first=Lucy|last=Campbell|title=Star Wars prequels 'not very much liked', admits Ewan McGregor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/28/star-wars-prequels-not-very-much-liked-says-ewan-mcgregor|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 28, 2021 |access-date=June 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605145336/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/28/star-wars-prequels-not-very-much-liked-says-ewan-mcgregor |archive-date=June 5, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="PrequelTrilogyBFI">Multiple sources, in chronological order:
